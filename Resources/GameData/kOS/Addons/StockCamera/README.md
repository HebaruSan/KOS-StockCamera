kOS Stock Camera Addon
**********************

#Description

This project is an addon for [kOS](https://github.com/KSP-KOS/KOS), which is a
mod for the game [Kerbal Space Program](https://kerbalspaceprogram.com/).  It
provides a method for controlling the game's stock camera position and
orientation.  The "stock" designation is important, as other mods that change
the camera's behavior may conflict with this functionality.

#Structures

#Building

You must have an IDE or compiler capable of building Visual Studio solutions
(.sln files).  For the sake of simplicity, this repository assumes that it will
be located next to the kOS repository, in the same parent directory.  All
references match those of kOS, and use relative paths pointing to the files in
the kOS repository.
