kOS Stock Camera Addon
**********************

#Description

This project is an addon for [kOS](https://github.com/KSP-KOS/KOS), which is a
mod for the game [Kerbal Space Program](https://kerbalspaceprogram.com/).  It
provides a method for controlling the game's stock camera position and
orientation.  The "stock" designation is important, as other mods that change
the camera's behavior may conflict with this functionality.
